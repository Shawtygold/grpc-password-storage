<!--This repository is a secure password management system. It consists of two main components: an **Authorization Server** for user authorization/authentication and a **Password Storage Server** for managing passwords. The project is designed to provide a robust and secure solution for storing and managing user credentials.-->

---
> ðŸ§© A secure password management system built as two core services: an `Authorization Server` that handles user authentication and access control, and a `Password Storage Server` dedicated to manage and protect user credentials. The system is engineered to provide a reliable and highly secure solution for storing and handling sensitive login information, ensuring user data is protected with AES 256 encryption algorithm.

## API Endpoints
- **Authorization Server**:
  - `[AuthProtoService.RegisterUser]`: register a user
  - `[AuthProtoService.Login]`: login
  - `[AuthProtoService.LoginWithRefreshToken]`: login with refresh token
  - `[AuthProtoService.RevokeRefreshTokens]`: revoke all user refresh tokens
    
- **Password Server**:
  - `[PasswordProtoService.CreatePassword]`: add a new password
  - `[PasswordProtoService.UpdatePassword]`: update an existing password
  - `[PasswordProtoService.DeletePassword]`: delete a password
  - `[PasswordProtoService.GetPasswords]`: get all user passwords by UserID 

**Note**: All Password Server endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header.
