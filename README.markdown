# PasswordBox

PasswordBox is a secure password management system built with C# and ASP.NET Core. It consists of two main components: an **Authorization Server** for user authentication and a **Password Storage Server** for managing passwords (adding, deleting, editing, and retrieving). The project is designed to provide a robust and secure solution for storing and managing user credentials.

## Features

- **Authorization Server**:
  - User registration and login.
  - JWT-based authentication for secure access.
  - Role-based access control (optional, can be extended).

- **Password Storage Server**:
  - Add new passwords with associated metadata (e.g., website, username).
  - Retrieve stored passwords securely.
  - Edit existing password entries.
  - Delete passwords.
  - Encrypted storage to ensure data security.

- **Security**:
  - Passwords are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
  - Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization checks.
  - HTTPS enforced for all communications.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: C# with ASP.NET Core
- **Database**: (Specify your database, e.g., SQL Server, SQLite, or PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Encryption**: AES or similar for password storage
- **Hosting**: Compatible with any platform supporting ASP.NET Core (e.g., Azure, AWS, or on-premises)

## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later)
- A database server (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional, for development)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PasswordBox.git
   cd PasswordBox
   ```

2. **Configure the environment**:
   - Update the `appsettings.json` file in both the Authorization Server and Password Storage Server projects with your database connection string and JWT settings.
   - Example `appsettings.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
         "DefaultConnection": "Your-Database-Connection-String"
       },
       "Jwt": {
         "Key": "Your-Secret-Key",
         "Issuer": "Your-Issuer",
         "Audience": "Your-Audience"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Restore dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Apply database migrations** (if using Entity Framework):
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project AuthorizationServer
   dotnet ef database update --project PasswordStorageServer
   ```

5. **Run the servers**:
   - Start the Authorization Server:
     ```bash
     dotnet run --project AuthorizationServer
     ```
   - Start the Password Storage Server:
     ```bash
     dotnet run --project PasswordStorageServer
     ```

6. **Access the APIs**:
   - Authorization Server: `https://localhost:5001` (or your configured port)
   - Password Storage Server: `https://localhost:5002` (or your configured port)

## API Endpoints

### Authorization Server
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.

### Password Storage Server
- `GET /api/passwords`: Retrieve all passwords for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/passwords/{id}`: Retrieve a specific password by ID.
- `POST /api/passwords`: Add a new password.
- `PUT /api/passwords/{id}`: Update an existing password.
- `DELETE /api/passwords/{id}`: Delete a password.

**Note**: All Password Storage Server endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

## Security Considerations

- Use strong, unique keys for JWT and encryption.
- Regularly rotate secrets and keys.
- Ensure your database is secured and not publicly accessible.
- Enforce HTTPS in production to protect data in transit.
